# Calculator with Optimized Shunting-Yard Algorithm

## Introduction

This repository contains a calculator application that efficiently parses and evaluates mathematical expressions using an optimized version of the Shunting-Yard algorithm. Unlike traditional implementations, this calculator combines the conversion of the expression to postfix notation and the calculation of the result in a single pass, resulting in improved memory usage and potentially faster execution.
